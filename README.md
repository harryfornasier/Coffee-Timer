Tired of burnt or cold coffee? Install Coffee Timer and never forget it on the stove again!

How It Works:

- Customisable Precision: Set timers in 5-minute increments (5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes) for tea, pour-over, French press, or cold brew.
- Simple Alerts: Hear a bell when the timer is up and go have a "damn fine cup of coffee".
- Distraction-Free Design: A clean interface lets you focus on your ritual, not fiddling with settings.

Things I want to add:

- A better looking UI Interface
- I want to be able to hide the app icon on the dock
- Animation for the moka pot
